In cars, your phone habits carry over: wake-word accuracy at phone level, apps and payments tied to your Huawei ID, Super Desktop brings familiar apps to the center screen, and maps/music/meetings hand off between phone, tablet, and cockpit.</p>\n\n<div>\n  <img src=\"https://auto.huawei.com/marketingcloud/pep/asset/20000004/ias-auto-car/img/hm_pc_kv250420.webp\" alt=\"HarmonyOS smart cockpit\" style=\"border-radius: 4px; width:100%\" />\n  <p>Consistent interaction and ecosystem handoff are the core HarmonyOS cockpit perks.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Models on This Site with HarmonyOS or Huawei Collaboration</h2>\n<p>The links below come from our <code>/menus</code> directory; each points to a Huawei-aligned cockpit page:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://toolsbox.vip/detail/seres-auto-huawei-evs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AITO / Seres</a>: HarmonyOS Cockpit + ADS 2, full-stack Huawei, best for deep ecosystem users.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://toolsbox.vip/detail/zeekr-premium-electric-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeekr</a>: Emphasizes multi-screen continuity and advanced driving—great on highway/long trips.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://toolsbox.vip/detail/voyah-luxury-electric-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Voyah</a>: Luxury comfort with strong media experience; family-friendly.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://toolsbox.vip/detail/gwm-electric-vehicle-lineup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GWM NEV</a>: Solid local app support and value, good for daily commuting.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://toolsbox.vip/detail/neta-auto-new-energy-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neta</a>: Covers everyday cockpit needs, ideal as a first EV.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n  <img src=\"https://auto.huawei.com/marketingcloud/pep/asset//20000004/ias-auto-car/img/fbh-yydh-pc251119.webp\" alt=\"Huawei multi-screen continuity\" style=\"border-radius: 4px; width:100%\" />\n  <p>Map from phone to car, then cast to a passenger tablet—multi-screen continuity in action.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>What to Test: Interaction, Ecosystem, Driving</h2>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Try one-shot voice commands (navigation + music + AC), phone-to-car map handoff, and screen casting latency. Check whether gestures/HUD add real value.<br />\n<strong>Ecosystem:</strong> Verify your core apps (navigation, music, video calls, kids content) are well adapted, share membership benefits, and keep accounts in sync.<br />\n<strong>Driving:</strong> Test City NOA/Highway NGP on tight streets, cloverleaf ramps, rain/fog. Note steering/braking smoothness for family comfort.</p>\n\n<h2>Buying & OTA Tips</h2>\n<p>Hardware matters: look at SoC/GPU, memory/storage headroom, and sensing redundancy (LiDAR, radar, camera count/FOV) to ensure room for future ADS upgrades. Before purchase, log in with your Huawei ID, try Super Desktop, in-car payments, and smart-home control (AC/lights). Check official OTA logs and owner feedback to confirm update cadence and stability.</p>\n\n<div>\n  <img src=\"https://auto.huawei.com/marketingcloud/pep/asset/20000004/ias-auto-car/img/hmpc_bannner04_01_250115_v2.webp\" alt=\"HarmonyOS ecosystem devices\" style=\"border-radius: 4px; width:100%\" />\n  <p>Account unification, payment loop, and home control are the ecosystem advantages.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Usage Checklist</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Bind your Huawei ID and trust the device; set up phone-car trust and navigation handoff first, then save routines/favorites.</li>\n  <li>Use a passenger tablet as a second screen for music/AC or map viewing; car hotspot can backfeed the tablet. Download offline maps/music for basements or rural areas.</li>\n  <li>Back up personalized settings (seats, ambient lights, nav prefs) before OTA; after updating, retest navigation, media, cameras, and parking.</li>\n  <li>Privacy: disable unnecessary always-on mic permissions, clear test accounts; on public Wi-Fi, disable auto-downloads and sensitive sync.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>HarmonyOS shines when experience consistency meets scene collaboration. Drive your daily routes, validate voice chains, app handoff, and driver-assist edge cases; then weigh price, range, charging network, and after-sales to choose the best fit.</p>\n"
